**AI voice NPCs and a per-Campaign knowledge base for tabletop RPGs.**

---

## What is Glyphoxa?

Glyphoxa is a multi-tenant TTRPG voice-and-knowledge platform. AI **Agents**
join a Discord **Voice Session**, voice a Campaign's **Character NPCs**, and
assist the **GM** — persisting **Transcripts** and a per-Campaign **Knowledge
Graph**. It never replaces the human storyteller; it is a co-pilot for the GM.

The **GM** runs the game from Discord (**Slash Commands**) and from an operator
web console (Provider Configs, Campaigns, Agents, Knowledge Graph, live
sessions). Written in Go for native concurrency and a streaming voice pipeline.

> **⚠️ Early Alpha** — under active development; APIs may change between commits.
> The system overview, including where the code diverges from the ADRs, lives in
> [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

## Modes

One binary, `cmd/glyphoxa`, runs one **Mode** at a time via `-mode`
([ADR-0005](docs/adr/0005-single-binary-modes-no-audio-rpc.md)). The default is
`all` — the self-host target ([ADR-0034](docs/adr/0034-deployment-artifacts.md)).

| Mode | What it runs |
|------|--------------|
| `all` (default) | Both halves in one process: the web tier that also owns the standing Discord presence (Slash Commands) and drives the voice loop in-process. Auto-applies migrations at startup. |
| `web` | A **Web Instance**: the operator console + Connect RPC API. Opens no Discord gateway, so it registers no Slash Commands. Assumes a current schema (no auto-migrate). |
| `voice` | A **Voice Instance**: the Discord Bot + the voice pipeline for one Guild/channel (requires `-guild`/`-channel`). No web API, no Slash Commands. |

`all` is the only Mode with the whole product in it. See
[docs/architecture.md §1](docs/architecture.md) for the process topology and the
default-Mode rationale.

## 🚀 Quick Start (self-host)

Glyphoxa self-hosts as a single **Operator**-owned deployment. The full runbook —
every environment variable, the Discord OAuth app, and the operator allowlist —
is [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md); the game-running walkthrough is
[docs/quickstart-gm.md](docs/quickstart-gm.md).

### Fastest: Docker Compose

`compose.yml` stands up a pgvector Postgres + the published Glyphoxa image
(`ghcr.io/mrwong99/glyphoxa`) in `-mode all`, which auto-migrates at startup —
so this reaches the login screen against a migrated DB with no separate
migrate step ([ADR-0034](docs/adr/0034-deployment-artifacts.md)). A machine
with only Docker needs nothing else:

```sh
cp .env.example .env              # fill GLYPHOXA_SECRET + DISCORD_OAUTH_* + GLYPHOXA_OPERATOR_IDS (docs/configuration.md §5–§6)
docker compose up
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:8080` and sign in with Discord. For a bare-metal
box, `deploy/glyphoxa.service` runs the same `-mode all` under systemd
(docs/configuration.md §10). To run against a source checkout instead of the
published image, `docker compose up --build` falls back to the local `build:`
(needs `make proto` + `(cd web && npm ci && npm run build)` first — see
docs/configuration.md §9).

### Build from source

### Prerequisites

- **Go 1.26+** — pure Go, `CGO_ENABLED=0`; no C toolchain
- **Node.js 20+ and npm** — the console bundle is embedded into the binary
- **[buf](https://buf.build/docs/installation)** — generates the Connect/protobuf stubs
- **Postgres with the [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) extension**
- For the `voice` loop: nothing extra — the codec (pion/opus), DAVE/MLS
  (dave-go), and the Silero VAD (bespoke pure-Go forward pass) are all in the
  binary — see [docs/agents/live-npc-run.md](docs/agents/live-npc-run.md)

### Build & run

```sh
git clone https://github.com/MrWong99/Glyphoxa.git
cd Glyphoxa

cp .env.example .env              # set at least DB + SECRET; -mode all also needs the DISCORD_OAUTH_* vars + GLYPHOXA_OPERATOR_IDS — see docs/configuration.md §5–§6
source .env                       # the template is shell-sourced (export NAME='value')

make proto                        # buf generate → gen/
(cd web && npm ci && npm run build)   # Vite bundle → internal/spa/dist
make build                        # → bin/glyphoxa

./bin/glyphoxa migrate up         # apply the schema (seed + explicit -mode web assume it is current)
./bin/glyphoxa seed               # seed the demo Tenant/Campaign/NPC (idempotent)
./bin/glyphoxa                    # -mode all is the default: serve the console + drive the voice loop
```

The default `-mode all` auto-applies migrations at startup, so a bare
`./bin/glyphoxa` needs no `migrate up` of its own — the explicit `migrate up`
above is only so `seed` (and an explicit `-mode web`) have a current schema.

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:8080` and sign in with Discord. The OAuth app and the
mandatory operator allowlist are set up in [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md)
§5–§6.

## 🔌 Provider Support

Bring-your-own-keys (BYOK, [ADR-0004](docs/adr/0004-byok-provider-key-matrix.md)):
Provider Configs are Tenant-scoped and encrypted at rest. Shipped adapters
(`pkg/voice`):

| Component | Providers |
|-----------|-----------|
| **STT** | ElevenLabs — batch + streaming ([ADR-0042](docs/adr/0042-streaming-stt-speculative-memory-recall.md)) |
| **TTS** | ElevenLabs |
| **LLM** | Groq, Google Gemini, Anthropic, OpenAI-compatible endpoints |
| **Embeddings** | Ollama |
| **VAD** | Silero (local, pure-Go forward pass) |
| **Audio** | Discord (DAVE/MLS end-to-end encrypted voice) |
| **Storage** | PostgreSQL + pgvector |

The MVP provider matrix is Groq (LLM) + ElevenLabs (STT + TTS). See
[docs/architecture.md §2.7](docs/architecture.md) for which adapters are wired
into the live loop.

## ✨ What ships today

- 🖥️ **Operator web console** — four screens (`login`, `configuration`,
  `campaign`, `session`): Provider Configs + Discord settings + spend caps,
  Campaigns/Agents/Tool Grants/Knowledge Graph, and Start/Stop of a live Voice
  Session with the live Transcript feed and NPC roster + mute.
- 🎙️ **Live Character NPCs** — a Voice Session voices a Campaign's Character NPCs
  through a streaming VAD → STT → Address Detection → LLM → TTS pipeline.
- 💬 **Slash Commands** (registered in `all` Mode) — `/roll <dice>` for anyone in
  the Guild; and, GM-only, `/glyphoxa use|start|end|search|mute|muteall`.
- 🗺️ **Knowledge Graph** — a per-Campaign structured wiki of typed Nodes and
  Edges in Postgres ([ADR-0008](docs/adr/0008-postgres-knowledge-graph-layered.md)),
  authored from the Campaign screen and fed into NPC Hot Context.
- 📜 **Transcript persistence + search** — every Voice Session's Transcript Lines
  are persisted for replay-on-reload and full-text search
  ([ADR-0040](docs/adr/0040-transcript-line-persistence.md)), from the console or
  via `/glyphoxa search`.
- 💸 **Spend caps** — per-Tenant soft/hard cost caps on a Voice Session
  ([ADR-0046](docs/adr/0046-spend-meter-price-map-cap-mechanics.md)).
- 📦 **Container image + Helm chart** — one OCI image (`Dockerfile`) and a
  Kubernetes chart (`deploy/charts/glyphoxa`), with migrations as a pre-install
  hook Job ([ADR-0034](docs/adr/0034-deployment-artifacts.md)).
